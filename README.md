# "M.H.M" - a HTML/CSS native website
This is a very basic website I created as my first HTML and CSS project for an intro to coding -course. 
You can find the website and it's landing page [here](https://luminietos.github.io/index.html).

## Description
This is a very basic website made using HTMl5 and CSS3, created in the spring of 2021 during my first semester of Uni. 
The theme and purpose I decided on for the website was mental health awareness and guidance, with the website showcasing many basic HTML/CSS functionalities 
like the href or img -attributes, moving, responsive and dynamic elements like forms, buttons, embedded videos and pictures, visual aids, etc.

## Step-by-step guide to using the site (should you need it)
By clicking the [link](https://luminietos.github.io/index.html) above, you'll be taken to the website's front page. 
While you can access all the pages through the navigation bar, there are also buttons at the bottom of the front-page that you can navigate with, if you're unsure of where to go.

There are two main pages on top of the landing page, as well as an 'about us' page.

The first of the two main pages contains indirect help. A 'pick-me-up', that offers a distraction for the user looking for help with their troubles. 
It contains links to relevant, external pages, embedded pictures and comic.
It also includes the same types of buttons found in all the pages, that will (on top of the aforementioned nav-bar) either take the user back to the front page, or to the secnd main page for more direct help.

The second main page contains more direct help for someone dealing with mental health issues, with resources ranging in urgency.
The buttons there will either take you back to the main page- if the user deems themselves alright- or to the first main page for a distraction.

A button that directs the user to the 'about us' page exists at the bottom of every single page- with the obvious exception of the 'about us' page itself.

The final, 'about us' page contains text further explaining the website fromt the POV of a fake company.
In reality there is no "we", just a single dev. It also contains a non-functional form and mailing list, as well as an embedded video.
At the bottom of the page, in the same spot where the link to this very page usually resides, there's a single button that takes the user back to the landing page, from where they can navigate where-ever they like.
